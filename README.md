# Tic-Tac-Toe Game  

This is a simple 'Tic-Tac-Toe' game implemented in C++. It allows two players to play alternately on a 3x3 grid, with a turn-based system and logic to check for a winner or a draw. The game is built using 'structured programming', with functions handling board display, player moves, and win detection.  

Key Features  

- Two-Player Mode – Players take turns marking their symbol (**'X'** or **'O'**) on the board.  
- Win Detection – The game checks for a win after every move based on rows, columns, and diagonals.  
- Draw Condition – If all spots are filled and no one wins, the game declares a draw.  
- Simple Console Interface – Players enter numbers to place their moves, making it easy to play.  
- Turn Management – Alternates turns between Player 1 and Player 2 automatically.  

How It Works  

1. Game Initialization – The game starts with an empty 3x3 board.  
2. Player Moves – Players choose a position (1-9) to place their symbol.  
3. Win Check – After each move, the game checks if a player has won.  
4. Draw Condition – If no moves are left and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.  
5. Game Over – The final board is displayed, and the winner (or draw result) is announced.  

Conclusion  

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple yet engaging project that demonstrates 'basic game logic' in C++. It effectively uses loops, conditionals, and functions to manage turns and determine the game outcome.
